# The Good, the Badge and the Ugly

The Good, the Badge and the Ugly is an interactive image quiz based on the weird world of Football Club badges, implemented through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Whilst thinking about a project idea to submit for Assignment 2, I stumbled upon an article from FourFourTwo magazine that listed the 17 weirdest badges in world football, and I decided to try and create a quiz based around the idea that some of the designs are so obtuse that it could be a fun challenge for the user to try and discern the name based on 3 multiple choice options, a format I enjoy from shows such as The Chase. In keeping with that intended structure, it was decided that the potential answers would have an (attempted) humourous edge to them, as the combination of unusual badge and comical potential answer would make for a memorable way to spend a couple of minutes for both casual and knowledeable sport lovers.

With that in mind, the design philosophy would be to create a intiutive, clean and most of all enjoyable quiz with an clear scoring system and an ability to choose a username and record a high score.
